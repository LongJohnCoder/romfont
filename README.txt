# What is this?
 
I have diassembled and/or searched VGA-ROMs for fonts and extracted these. 
Also I have written a few tools to support this job. 
All extracted fonts and screenshots are available here. 
 
 
# Build
Most likely you dont need to build all this stuff, if you only want to look at 
the screenshots or get the extracted fonts. 
 
If you want to build: 
You need bash, libsdl-dev, libsdl-gfx-dev, imagemagick and gcc to build and run.
Either click on download as zip on github page or clone via commandline.
Once you have the source, do this in source folder: 
```
$ make
$ ./gen_headers.sh
$ ./gen_images.sh
```
